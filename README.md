## Pixel art

Project developed during block 05, in which the _DOM tree, events, and JavaScript storage_ were studied.

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. Creation of the ___pixel panel___ through JavaScript;
2. Color the pixels according to the ___selected color___;
3. Always have black as the ___first___ color in the options table;
4. The other color choices are generated ___randomly___ when loading the page;
5. By clicking the _clear_ button all pixels change their `backgroundColor` to ___white___.
Beyond that, by choosing a number from the `input` area and pressing the `VQV` button, we generate a new _board_ with the desired size. That is, if we send the value 8, a panel with 8 pixels wide and 8 pixels high will be created, resulting in 64 pixels in total.

> However, if we add a value _lower_ than 5, a frame with 25 pixels will be created. And if we add a value _higher_ than 50, the _board_ will have only 2500 pixels.
